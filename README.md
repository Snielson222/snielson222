My name is Steven Nielson and I’m a software engineer who recently graduated from App Academy. I am passionate about research and learning; if I don’t know something today I can learn it by tomorrow. My masters degree in research psychology and batchelors degree in psychology & philosophy taught me the value of having a positive attitude, logic, and critical thinking that I bring to every workplace. These experiences also enhanced my soft skills of cooperation, communication, and understanding that aid me not only on the job but in my daily life. Working as a carpenter taught me the value of teamwork and attention to detail that allowed me and my team to never have to look for work or advertise, just keep crafting exquisite bathrooms for high end clients. I have always loved technology working my way up to assistant manager of the laptop help desk during college and keeping up with the most recent trends. In my free time I like to cook, hike with my dogs, and play video games with my wife.
