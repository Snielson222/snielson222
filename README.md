Hello, I'm Steven Nielson, a dedicated software engineer and proud graduate of App Academy. My diverse background has shaped my journey, blending a master's degree in research psychology with bachelor's degrees in both psychology and philosophy. This unique combination instilled in me not only a passion for learning but also a set of valuable skills—positivity, logical thinking, and critical analysis—that I consistently bring to every professional endeavor.
My experience extends beyond the realm of software engineering. Working as a carpenter, I honed my teamwork and attention-to-detail skills, understanding the significance of precision and collaboration in achieving exceptional results. During college, I ascended to the role of assistant manager at the laptop help desk, where I not only addressed technical challenges but also stayed abreast of the latest trends in technology. This role required a balance of technical expertise and effective communication, skills that I continue to prioritize in my work.
Beyond my technical aptitude, I place great value on soft skills cultivated through various experiences. Cooperation, communication, and understanding are integral components of my approach, not only within the professional sphere but also in my daily life. Outside of work, I find joy in diverse pursuits. I'm an avid chef, an enthusiastic hiker, and I enjoy bonding over video games with my wife. These activities reflect my commitment to a balanced and fulfilling life.
